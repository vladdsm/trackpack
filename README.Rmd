The goal of trackpack is to track my package

## Installation

You can install the released version of trackpack from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("trackpack")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(trackpack)

## business logic code
library(ggplot2)
library(cranlogs)
stats <- cran_downloads("lazytrade", from = Sys.Date() - 100, to = Sys.Date() - 1) 
#sum(stats$count)


ggplot(stats, aes(date, count)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(
    title = sprintf(
      "{stats} downloads to %s", 
      Sys.Date() - 1
      ), 
    caption = "data from {cranlogs}"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()



```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
